# Shell Application in C

## Description
I implemented this project as an assignment of my OS class. In this project, you will get more familiar with the Unix system call interface and the shell by implementing several features in a small shell, called kabuk. The main part of the project requires development of an interactive Unix-style operating system shell. After executing kabuk, kabuk will read both system and user-de ned commands from the user. For more details please see Project.pdf.

### Special Features
 - One can set alarms with a selected mp3 via shell.
 - One can encrypt and decrypt files with selected passwords.
